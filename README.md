# LiveSplit.ContextualSlideshow
## What does it do?
It is what it sounds like, a slideshow of components. It cycles through Previous Segment, Current Pace, and Possible Time Save. Very minorly useful I guess, you can just have this single component added instead of those 3 and save a little bit of space.
